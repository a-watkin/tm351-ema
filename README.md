# An analysis of bat hibernation and roost data

*The analysis are in jupyter notebooks, if you click on either of them above github should render the output for them.*

Multi bat species cohabitation at roost sites was explored. Bat species abundance counts were grouped and then clustering based on derived statistical values using the k-means algorithm. Silhouette analysis was used to judge clustering quality. This was then compared to actual cohabitation counts at roost sites.

Chisquared test was used to determin if the differences between roose and hibernation abundance is significant.
